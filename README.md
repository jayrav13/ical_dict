# ical-dict

iCalDict is a Python library that converts an iCalendar file (.ics) into a Dictionary object in Python.

One of the unique features of this library is that it also allows a client to pass a simple dictionary which converts all of the iCalendar keys into keys that the client is interested in using instead.

An example output for `events.ics` is available in `events.json`.
